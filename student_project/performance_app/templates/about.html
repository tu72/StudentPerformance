                        This project presents a Student Performance Prediction System, a web-based platform combining machine learning techniques with educational data analysis to enhance student success. The system addresses the critical challenge faced by educators in identifying struggling students early enough for effective intervention. By analyzing key indicators such as grades, attendance, and study habits, the system provides timely insights for both teachers and students.

                        In the modern education system, improving student performance is a key goal for both teachers and students. However, understanding the factors that affect student success and identifying struggling students in advance can be challenging. Educators often rely on manual processes or basic tools, which may not provide the insights needed for early interventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project aims to solve this problem by developing a Student Performance Prediction System using machine learning. The system will analyze data such as grades, attendance, and study habits to predict student performance. Teachers can use these predictions to identify students who need extra support, while students can receive personalized recommendations to improve their learning outcomes.

                        By combining advanced machine learning techniques with a user-friendly web platform, this project seeks to make it easier for educators to monitor performance and take timely actions to help students succeed.
